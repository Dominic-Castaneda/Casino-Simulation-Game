## Overview
This is a 3D casino simulation game developed in Unity. The idea was to recreate the immersive experience of walking through a casino and interacting with classic games like slot machines and blackjack tables. It's designed to feel social, atmospheric, and engaging.

## Environment & Mechanics
I built the casino using modular prefabs, lighting, and texture mapping to create a believable layout. Player movement uses Unityâ€™s Character Controller, and interaction logic is handled via raycasting. Slot machine functionality was implemented using random number generation and animation triggers.

What I Learned
This was my first deep dive into Unity 3D and C#. I learned how to structure a scalable scene, work with prefabs, handle player input, and begin planning out multiplayer architecture. It gave me confidence to keep going deeper into Unity game development.
